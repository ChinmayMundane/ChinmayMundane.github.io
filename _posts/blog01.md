Strange title for a blog, isn’t it? But it manages to sum up our(at least my) experience quite well. A friend of mine told me about this Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) winter school at IIT Delhi, and I thought, “Why not?” I was curious about the topics they were offering and thought it would be nice to dive into the theory behind them. Plus, who wouldn’t want to see IIT Delhi :) 
The process was quite easy as well, which consisted of filling up a google form, with 4 preferred topics and some other things like my interests, motivation for applying, transcript, etc. 

There were 9 projects in total, and about 30 students would be assigned to one based on their preferences and prior experience. This year’s setup was different because the entire winter school would focus on one specific topic, unlike previous years when it was a mix of everything. I thought this was a great idea since there’s only so much you can cover in depth in a short time. Each professor had a scheduled date for when their sessions would be held, and since some topic dates overlapped, it gave us a chance to meet people from other domains too. The result were declared shortly after, via mail and I got selected for my first choice - computational social choice along with 9 other participants.

I arrived a day prior before the school commenced and took my time settling into the hostel. We were also given the cards for mess. Both hostels were pretty comfortable, equipped with a mattress, pillow, bucket, blanket, table, etc. The mess food was really good! After dinner, I went to meet with rest of the fellows who arrived same day and were assigned same project as me. Since they’d arrived earlier, they had already explored the campus and gave me a quick tour when we went for a walk. After chatting and roaming around, we headed back since it was getting pretty cold.

On the first day we had one talk online by Prof. Sanjam Garg from UC Berkeley about his learning experience as a researcher. It was inspiring to hear how he started with no coding knowledge or research and ended up diving into cryptography. He gave us some really valuable insights into what it’s like to be a researcher. 

Some of the points he made were:

 

- **Focus on Important Problems:** he mentioned that we should think about what’s the most important problems we might want to work on and that in a decade or so, we will realize that measure portion of it has been solved by that time which he backed up by his own experience. He made it a point that “if you do not work on those problems, you should be certain that someone else just might and it will certainly be solved(made significant progress) in near future. And so, you have no reason not to work on it.”
- **The PhD Mindset:** Another interesting thing he said was that in recent times, PhD students have too much pressure of solving such problems during their PhD tenure which he thought was wrong. To tackle this he focused on thinking PhD as getting a Driver’s license. You learn how to drive and now you have all the time to drive and improve. Similarly, PhD teaches you about research and then you can always extend it in coming years or change your direction. The important thing is to work persistently in small(publishable) steps towards important problems, not thinking of solving it at one go.

After the talk, we headed to Bharti building where our group was supposed to meet. We had an introduction session first where each person briefly introduced themselves, where they were from, their branch, year, college and what made them interested in this topic. The group was a diverse mix, with people from IITs, IISERs, IIITs, PSG Tech, and backgrounds in CS, mathematics, EECS, and economics. There were BTech/BS students as well as Master's and one upcoming PhD student.

The lectures weren’t like typical college classes with a set curriculum. Instead, they were more about introducing the research process in Computational Social Choices (rather the focus was on how research process takes place for any topic). The approach was more discussion-based, with a few proofs here and there (but mostly proof-by-example). It felt more like a conversation with peers than a lecture, and that made the whole experience super engaging. The discussion was quite enjoyable and full of curiosity. On the first day, [Rohit sir](https://rohitvaish.in/) introduced us to some foundational concepts, and then we dug into some open problems in the field later days. He’d often throw out some thought-provoking ideas, and then we’d go for a walk to let it sink in. These walks were a great way to digest what we’d just discussed — plus, they gave us a chance to chat with Sir and each other, often over a cup of ~~coffee~~ cappuccino. I remember one time, we were near a shop, and some random guy was explaining [SLAM](https://medium.com/machinevision/overview-of-slam-50b7f49903b7) (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) to his friend. We quietly listened in for a bit, then moved on to the same topic among us.

We would have enough breaks to wonder about ideas and get to know each other. Talking to them during breaks, I got to know of how everyone’s been working on something interesting and got good picture of the research world beyond my own domain. These people brought fresh perspectives and several new ideas to the discussions which made attending it more interesting. 

The lecture were designed to be more generalized to the students and easy to follow, although some prior knowledge about Discrete mathematics and computational complexity would be nice to have. We would start with some basic fundamentals of the topic, build some formal definitions around it and then would think of some counter examples. At the end, we would have gone through all the new research in that area and be stuck on some open problems. We mostly studied [Stable matchings](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stable_marriage_problem) and [fair allocation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fair_item_allocation) of the goods. I was amazed to know that the Deferred Aceeptance algorithm in stable matchings was being used in JOSAA councilling to match students with their preferred colleges. This made me more aware of theoretical computer science being used in real life. In Fair allocation, we learnt about envy freeness of the goods(also called as EF), Envy Free up to at most one item(EF1) and Envy freeness upto at most any item(EFX). There was also one discussion with MS student who showed us how cake cutting can be done by using [sperner’s lemma](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sperner%27s_lemma) for almost equvivalent division of cake. 

we also had an excursion with our faculty mentors, visiting the National Museum of Art Gallery, followed by lunch nearby where we continued chatting and relaxing. On the final day, there was a presentation on allocation algorithms, focusing on mixed instances of divisible and indivisible goods, as well as allocations for chores.

Overall, I thoroughly enjoyed the winter school. It was not only fun but also intellectually stimulating to think about open problems alongside the faculty and fellow participants. If you're considering attending, I highly recommend it — also be ready for many engaging discussions, new learning experiences and ofc - delhi winters :)
