Hi! I am Chinmay Mundane, a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Production Engineering, [VJTI](https://vjti.ac.in/) Mumbai. 

I am also a Visiting researcher at [Multi-Robot Autonomy Laboratory](https://moonlab.iiserb.ac.in/), IISER Bhopal advised by [Prof. P.B Sujit](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qqwyAwoAAAAJ&hl=en) and researcher at [NUS](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html), singapore. Previously, I have worked with [Prof. Arpita Sinha](https://in.linkedin.com/in/drarpitasinha) at IIT Bombay on intersection management of autonomous vehicles, [Prof. Faruk Kazi](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-faruk-kazi-vjti) at VJTI on developing a pipe traversing biometric robot. 

My research interests are in the domain of Autonomous Driving, Computer Vision, Learning and Reinforcement Learning. My current research works are on integrating safety for the navigation of autonomous vehicles and perception of off-road autonomous vehicles.
When I am not doing the above, I prefer to read books, write poetry, or play piano.
