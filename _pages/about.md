Hi! I am Chinmay Mundane, a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Production Engineering, [VJTI](https://vjti.ac.in/) Mumbai. 

I am a Visiting Student researcher at [Multi-Robot Autonomy Laboratory](https://moonlab.iiserb.ac.in/), IISER Bhopal advised by [Prof. P.B Sujit](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qqwyAwoAAAAJ&hl=en) and remote intern at [NUS](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html), singapore. Previously, I have worked with [Prof. Arpita Sinha](https://in.linkedin.com/in/drarpitasinha) at IIT Bombay on intersection management of autonomous vehicles, [Prof. Faruk Kazi](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-faruk-kazi-vjti) at VJTI on developing a pipe traversing biometric robot. 


My research interests lie in motion control and path planning, for which I often rely on controls and Learning methods. I believe that combining control techniques with reinforcement learning can effectively address navigation challenges for both single and multi-agents. To evaluate these methods, I use ROS and have implemented these methods in simulation as well as hardware(TurtleBot, DAAGU, ATV). I have found software such as CARLA, MetaDrive, and SUMO to be highly effective for my research where I'm focusing on safety during exploration and off-road navigation using RL methods. I am actively seeking a research intern/assistant position for Fall/Summer 2025.
