Hi! I am Chinmay Mundane, a final year undergraduate student at the Department of Production Engineering, [VJTI](https://vjti.ac.in/) Mumbai. 

I am a Visiting Student researcher at [Multi-Robot Autonomy Laboratory](https://moonlab.iiserb.ac.in/), IISER Bhopal advised by [Prof. P.B Sujit](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=qqwyAwoAAAAJ&hl=en) and remote intern at [NUS](https://www.marmotlab.org/bio.html), singapore. Previously, I have worked with [Prof. Arpita Sinha](https://in.linkedin.com/in/drarpitasinha) at IIT Bombay on intersection management of autonomous vehicles, [Prof. Faruk Kazi](https://in.linkedin.com/in/dr-faruk-kazi-vjti) at VJTI on developing a pipe traversing biometric robot. 

My research interests are in the domain of Autonomous Driving, Motion and Path Planning and Reinforcement Learning. My current research works are on integrating safety for the navigation of autonomous vehicles and off-road navigation using RL methods. I am actively seeking a research intern/assistant position for Fall 2025, with the possibility of starting as early as Summer 2025, if needed.
