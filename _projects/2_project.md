**In this project, aim was to build a bot for deployment in an arena which is an abstraction of different settings in a Smart City.** To enable the robot to do more complex motion, there was a need to explore an exciting type of mobile locomotion, known as Holonomic Drive. Unlike the usual, more popular differential drive robots, **the holonomic drive robots can control all the three degrees of freedom possible on a plane** (translation along the x, y-axis and rotation along the z-axis). This gives the robot the ability to make art that would otherwise not be possible with the usual two-wheeled differential drive robot.
This was done on simulation and was simplified into 3 parts (or tasks)

here's a video for implementation
